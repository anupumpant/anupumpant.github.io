Let me start by saying it was surprisingly easy to make my GitHub page! You can either follow the 2 min official guide [here](https://pages.github.com/), or follow the steps below.

### Step 1
Of course, I first needed a GitHub account (I had one). [Make one for yourself](https://github.com/).

### Step 2
I then clicked the [create repository](https://github.com/new) link on the top left corner of the first page (as shown below) after I logged in.

### Step 3
Say your GitHub ID is  '112233' (mine is '[anupumpant](https:github.com/anupumpant)'). In the  'Repository name' section, write '112233.github.io' and hit create repository. Since my username is anupumpant, I made a repository named 'anupumpant.github.io'.

### Step 4
Inside the repository I created a file called 'index.html'.
To do this, I clicked 'Create new file' near the top of the repository (shown below).

<img src="/assets/images/createfile-button.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="75" />

Then I wrote 'index.html' in the 'Name your file' section.
And copy pasted the following basic HTML code in the big white space below it.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

The end result looked like this:
<img src="/assets/images/createfile.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="400" />

### Step 5
I clicked 'Commit new file' button at the bottom of the page. Done!
My basic website at 'anupumpant.github.io' was ready (replace 'anupumpant' with your username, again).

Sure I Spiced it up later using the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme and it started looking like it is now. Their [quick start guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) was easy to follow and took me only a few minutes to set this website up. I would encourage you to go ahead and try your hand at it.
