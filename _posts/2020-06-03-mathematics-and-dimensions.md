I was at a [friend's](https://yuchaz.github.io/) PhD general exam today. Honestly, I didn't grasp much but was there to support him. Firstly, it made me aware of my ignorace. He talked about his work in higher-dimensional geometric data analysis methods. Secondly, here's what I thought:

Mathematicians have developed tools that let them handle complicated stuff using simple abstractions. It helps them peer deeper into the reality. Our senses in comparision provide access to only a few of those dimensions.

In the words of Paul Dirac:

> "Mathematics is the tool specially suited for dealing with abstract concepts of any kind and there is no limit to its power in this field."
> -Paul Dirac

> "I learned to distrust all physical concepts as the basis for a theory. Instead one should put one's trust in a mathematical scheme, even if the scheme does not appear at first sight to be connected with physics. One should concentrate on getting interesting mathematics."
> -Paul Dirac

> "God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world."
> -Paul Dirac

This, I think is why, like Charlie Munger says, we should strive to develop a lattice work of foundational concepts from mathematics [too].

> "You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models."
> -Charlie Munger
