Let me start by saying it was surprisingly easy You can either follow the 2 min guide [here](https://pages.github.com/), or follow the steps below.

### Step 1
Of course, you need a GitHub account first. So go ahead and [make one for yourself](https://github.com/) if you do not have it yet.

### Step 2
Click the create repository link on the top left corner of the first page (as shown below) after I logged in.

<img src="/assets/images/create_rep_button.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="75" />

### Step 3
Say your GitHub ID is  **123**. In the  **Repository name** section, write **123.github.io** and hit create repository.

### Step 4
Create a file called **index.html**.
To do this, first click **Create new file** near the top of the repository (shown below).

<img src="/assets/images/createfile-button.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="75" />
Write **index.html** in the **Name your file** section.
And copy paste the following in the big white space below it.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

It should look like this now:
<img src="/assets/images/createfile.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="400" />

### Step 5
Click the commit new file button on the bottom of the page. Done!
You can now go to the website called **123.github.io** (replace 123 with your username, again), and see your basic html.
Spicing it up is super easy too. I will share that in the next post.
