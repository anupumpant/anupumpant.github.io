I do not get Github. I want to get it.
I want to build useful stuff on it like [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net) has done.
Do I start a project? Or do I start a repository? And then how does markdown formatting work? There seems to be a learning curve.
Here's my first repository.

# First place to start:

### [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/) - 67 min read
The link contains the following guides. You may not need to read all of them at first. I started with the 'Mastering Markdown' first.

# Lesson 1 - Writing Markdown:

I was curious about markdowns first. In an effort to learning-by-doing I wanted to make a new repository and write a 'Readme.md'. For reference, I used this 'Readme.md' document created by [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net) [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd/master/README.md). The output of which looks like [this](https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-2nd).

### Step 1:
I made a GitHub account (I had an existing account). I simply logged into my account from [GitHub.com](https://github.com/login).

### Step 2:
I clicked the create repository link on the top left corner of the first page (as shown below) after I logged in.

<img src="/assets/images/create_rep_button.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="75" />

### Step 3:
I filled in the form as shown below. I did not know anything about the licenses I could use. So I left this last section with its default values. Note to self: Learn about the various licenses.

<img src="/assets/images/create_rep.PNG" align="center"  alt="Create repository form" height="400" />

### Step 4:
In my 'Readme.md' I replaced all of the default text with the markdown syntax that produces the thing you are reading now. You can obtain the syntax I used by clicking on 'Raw' button near the top of this page (also shown in the image below).

<img src="/assets/images/raw_button.PNG" align="center" alt="Create repository button" height="50" />

### Step 5:
To add the images, I took the screenshots of the corresponding steps as I went through the process and saved them in a folder on my PC. Later I uploaded them and updated the image filenames in the '<img>' tags in the raw markdown file. For uploading them, I first went to the [repository link](https://github.com/anupumpant/github-for-dummies) and clicked on the upload button near the top of that page (also shown in the image below).

<img src="/assets/images/upload_button.PNG" alt="Upload button" height="50" />

### Step 6:
I then hit the 'Commit changes' button under the place where I had edited the raw markdown file. Done!
